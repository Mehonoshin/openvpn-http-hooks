This ruby gem is wrapper for OpenVPN server daemon.

The main purpose of this gem - is to interact with remote API, located at billing system.

This allows to authenticate user, track his connects/disconnects, apply hooks on connect/disconnect.

## Installation

It is assumed, that the gem is installed directly to VPS/docker image with OpenVPN server. So the preferred solution is to install it directly to the system, without `bundler` tool usage.

`gem install smartvpn-http-hooks`
